This repository contains the coursework for a class Architecture of Computing Systems on the subject of Branch Prediction Using Decision Trees. 

Logs were fetched from the MIPT-MIPS simulator and, honestly, not so much code was added. But we don't need more than that, I guess. They use PC Address, Target Address, Taken/Not Taken (Branch Outcome) and Hit/Miss. Basically, everything that was used by Daniel Jimenez in his Championship Branch Predictor in 2004, so this data should be sufficient. 

It seems that trees do not handle well large data, so it had to be truncated/shortened to get somewhat adequate results.

This coursework took much more time than it might seem it did. It didn't turn out completely perfect, yes, but I did my best.
